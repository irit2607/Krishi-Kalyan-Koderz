<h3 style="text-align: center;">Problem Statement - Portal of Government schemes (Common platform for all farmers to get information about No. of schemes availed by farmers)</h3>


<h4 style="text-align: center;">Team Name: KODERZ</h4>

<p style="font-size: 18px;  margin-left: 1em;">We aim to create a portal that will help farmers to take advantage of the schemes availed by the Indian government.<br><br>
Our portal will incorporate the following feature:<br><br>

1)Our project is a Portal which has a list of the schemes concerning farmers. These schemes are laid down by the Indian government.
It is useful for farmers since using this portal they can claim the benefits of the schemes. Even if they can't apply for certain schemes, they are aware of the schemes.<br>

2)Search form<br>
A search form is also available on the portal to search for schemes that one can apply to and benefit from. One simply has to answer the given questions in the form and the scheme that suits them best will be shown. No login is required in this portal.<br><br>
	
3)Automatic updating of schemes<br>
Once this portal is linked to the government, then they can add/ remove, or make changes in any of the schemes in the list. <br><br>

4)Contact form<br>
Contact form is provided in the portal. If any user finds any sort of doubts they can fill up the contact form and can also give feedback, to record the experience of the users using this portal.
<br><br>

--- The website is fully responsive! <br>

--- We have taken around 12 schemes for this website. Further more schemes can be added easily and also form can be updated as per needs!<br><br>
